  "readme": "# grunt-compass\n\nThis is a custom grunt.js multitask that executes `compass compile` on the command line for you and prints the COMPASS output to `grunt.log.write()`.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nYou need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [grunt.js](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) installed for this to work.\n\n## Installation & Options\n\n1. Install this grunt plugin next to your project's grunt.js gruntfile with: `npm install grunt-compass`.\n2. Call `grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-compass')` in your gruntfile.\n3. Configure `grunt watch` to watch your scss files and call the task.\n\te.g.:\n\n\t```javascript\n\twatch: {\n\t    files: ['assets/scss/partials/*.scss'],\n\t    tasks: ['compass:somename']\n\t}\n\t```\n\n4. Setup the config for compass in your grunt config, or setup a compass config file:\n\t* Option 1: Set the configuration for compass in your grunt.js file:\n\n\t\t```javascript\n\t\tcompass: {\n            somename: {\n                src: 'assets/scss/partials',\n                dest: 'assets/css/partials'\n            }\n\t\t}\n\t\t```\n\n\t\t\"src\" is the folder with sass/scss files.\n\t\t\"dest\" is the file where the css files will be place.\n\t* Option 2: Setup a compass project\n\t\t```\n\t\tcompass install compass\n\t\t```\n5. You can set your custom output style like this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    compass: {\n        somename: {\n            outputstyle: 'compressed'\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n6. You can disable line comments like this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    compass: {\n        somename: {\n            linecomments: false\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n7. If you have multiple compass tasks and you want to force compass compilation you can do this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    compass: {\n        somename: {\n            forcecompile: true\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n8. You can require a given ruby library before running commands\n\n    ```javascript\n    compass: {\n        somename: {\n            require: 'animate-sass mylib'\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n9. You can add the `--debug-info` option for use with [FireSass](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firesass-for-firebug/) like so:\n\n    ```javascript\n    compass: {\n        somename: {\n            debugsass: true\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n10. You can set the relative assets to `true` and set an image path for Compass spriting feature:\n\n    ```javascript\n    compass: {\n        somename: {\n            images: '/path/to/images',\n            relativeassets: true\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n\n11. Run \"grunt watch\" and change some SASS files :)\n\n# Real World Examples\n\n* [krzysu](https://github.com/krzysu) posted a Gist with his `compass compile` configuration [over here](https://gist.github.com/2917330).\n* [javiervd](https://github.com/javiervd) kindly shares his grunt.js setup [over here](https://gist.github.com/2941501).\n\n# Changelog\n\nv0.2.11: The option to set the image path for spriting and the relativeassets to true have been added by @[gcpantazis](https://github.com/gcpantazis).\n\nv0.2.11: @[gcpantazis](https://github.com/gcpantazis) added the option to set the `--debug-info` flag for Sass, useful for integration with the FireSass debugger.\n\nv0.2.10: Added 'gruntplugin' as a keyword in the package.json to get listed [here](http://jsfiddle.net/cowboy/qzRjD/show/).\n\nv0.2.9: Ability to require a given ruby lib before running commands. Added by @[FGRibreau](https://github.com/FGRibreau).\n\nv0.2.8: Added an option to force compilation of SASS files via the `--force` option.\n\n----\n\n# LICENSE MIT\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Kahlil Lechelt\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
